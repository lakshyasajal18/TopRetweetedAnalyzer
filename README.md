# TopRetweetedAnalyzer
Analyze tweets to find top retweeted users. Uses dictionaries for efficient user and retweet count storage. Customizable for varying user counts. 

Longer description:

This Python function, top_retweeted, is designed to analyze a file containing tweets and identify the top users who have received the most retweets. The function takes two parameters: the name of the file containing tweets (tweets_file_name) and the number of top retweeted users to retrieve (num_top_retweeted). It returns a dictionary where the keys are the top retweeted users' handles and the values are their corresponding retweet counts.

The function begins by initializing variables to keep track of retweet-related metrics such as total tweets, retweet tweets, and retweet counts for individual users. It then opens the specified file for reading and iterates through each line. If a line indicates a retweet (identified by starting with "RT "), it extracts the Twitter handle of the retweeted user and updates their retweet count in the dictionary retweet_counts.

After processing all the lines in the file, the function prints summary information about the tweets, including the total number of tweets and the number of retweets. It then sorts the retweet_counts dictionary based on retweet counts in descending order and retrieves the top num_top_retweeted users. Finally, it formats the results into a dictionary with user handles prefixed with "@" and their corresponding retweet counts.

Three sample invocations of the function (top_retweeted) are provided (top_retweets1.txt, top_retweets2.txt, and top_retweets3.txt) to demonstrate its usage with different input files and varying numbers of top retweeted users to retrieve.
